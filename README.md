# üöÄ PDF Editor in JavaScript - Edit PDFs like a Boss!

Welcome to this exciting project that transforms your browser into a powerful PDF editor! Built purely in JavaScript, it allows you to add some pizzazz into your boring PDFs with text and images, and save them - all directly in your browser. No server-side processing, no problem!

## üéâ Features

- **Edit PDF files in your browser**: Why download when you can do it online?
- **Add text and images**: Make your PDFs more engaging!
- **Save edited PDFs**: Keep what you love, discard what you don't!
- **Pure JavaScript**: Because we love JavaScript!

## üìö Libraries Used

This project shines thanks to several amazing libraries:

- [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/): Our magic wand for working with HTML canvas elements.
- [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF): Our partner-in-crime for generating PDF files in JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Our secret sauce for rapidly building custom user interfaces that are as unique as you are!

## üî® Building

We believe in the power of [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), which bundles our JavaScript code and morphs TypeScript into JavaScript.
